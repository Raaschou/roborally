# Temp. README - to remember what to include in it and what we've done..
This Readme is intended for TA's - at somepoint.. for now more of a reminder.

# Game phases

# Movement

# Game Boards 
    - we have made some gameboards 

## Checkpoint
    - checkpoints checked after all progamming phase?? is done.. 
    - checkpoints are executed as the first action. that means they have priority over eg. conveyor belts.
        - this means that only one player will be able to get a given checkpoint in a turn
    - TODO implement winning player - the first player to collect all checkpoints.
    - TODO write tests for checkpoints.

## Conveor Belt
    - conveyor belt cannot bump players.
    - if the end of an conveyor belts can be blocked by players 
    - conveyor belts movement are blocked by walls.


# Tests
    - The functionalities of the gamecontroller is tested thorughly 
    - We have runned manually end to end tests. <- at some point I think.
